    the path through the maze. Returns: A string containing the movement
    directions using ``N``, ``S``, ``E``, and ``W``. Example: A path such as

Write the generated maze and its solution to a file.
The maze cells are encoded from their wall values into binary,
converted to a hexadecimal digit, and written row by row.
After the maze data, the function writes the entry coordinates,
exit coordinates, and the solution path as movement directions.
Args: maze: The MazeGenerator object containing the generated grid,
start position, and end position. mazefile: The path of the file
where the maze will be written.
path: The shortest path represented as a list of ``(row, column)`` coordinates.
The MazeGenerator import is placed under ``TYPE_CHECKING``
so it is available to type checkers without importing it at runtime.
This helps avoid circular import problems between modules.
Raises: OSError: If the output file cannot be opened or written.
