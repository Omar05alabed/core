""" Represent a single cell in the maze. A cell stores its position in the
 maze,
    whether it has been visited during maze generation, the state of its four
      walls,
        and the coordinates of its neighboring cells.

    Attributes: row: The row index of the cell in the maze grid.
    colm: The column index of the cell in the maze grid.
        visited: Whether the cell has been visited during maze generation.
            walls: A dictionary containing the four walls of the cell.

    ``True`` means the wall is closed and ``False`` means the wall is open.
    neighbors: A dictionary mapping each direction to the coordinates of the
      neighboring cell.
    Directions: ``N``: North, one row above. ``E``: East, one column to the
      right. ``S``: South, one row below.
    ``W``: West, one column to the left.
