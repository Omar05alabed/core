"""
Find the shortest path between the maze start and end positions.
This function uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore the maze.
BFS visits positions level by level, which guarantees
that the first time the end position is reached,
the discovered path contains the minimum number of moves.
The function only moves through open walls and ignores positions
that are outside the maze or have already been visited.
Args: maze: The MazeGenerator containing the maze grid, start position,
and end position.
Returns: A list of ``(row, column)`` coordinates representing
the shortest path from the start position to the end position.
The start and end positions are included in the returned list.
Raises: ValueError: If there is no path between the start and end positions.
